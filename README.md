# personal-portfolio-css-
This project is a styled personal portfolio website built using HTML5 and CSS3.  
The website showcases my profile, skills, and contact details with a modern and responsive design.
The main goal of this project was to apply CSS styling techniques to improve visual appearance, layout structure, and responsiveness.
